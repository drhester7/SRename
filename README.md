# SRename

This script is used for renaming the episodes of an entire season of a TV Show within a linux OS.
Episodes are named with the format [ShowName S##E##.mkv]

***THIS SCRIPT ASSUMES THE VIDEOS ARE ALREADY IN THE CORRECT ORDER***

To run:
	navigate to the directory that the season of the show is located and run "./pathtoSRename/SRename"

or
	move SRename to /bin
	navigate to the directory that the season of the show is located and run "SRename"


*Known Issues*

This script does not read the current file extension of the videos resulting in always using ".mkv"
